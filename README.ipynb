    "### How to Get Last Few Lines from a CSV File Using Windows PowerShell\n",
    "I had to see last few rows of a large CSV file (>16 GB); it was too large to open in Excel. So I obtained the last few rows from that file and wrote it to another file using Windows PowerShell. Input.csv is my large file and Output.csv is the output file.\n",
